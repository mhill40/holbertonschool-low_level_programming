mhill 0x00 c assignment

****EDIT AS OF INDEPENDANCE DAY WEEKEND / MOMDAY: I HAVE A NEW SOLID UNDERSTANING AND HAVE REWORKED EVERY ONE OF MY FILES*****8

The project was about learning how C is structured, the syntax, and how to compile code with gcc and to a lesser extent npm and pip3, and how main is the starting point of a c program and things direct and squence from there. very fun.


things to remember is main at the beginning is the main function of the program. you need a main.c. void basically mean the function wont return any ifo
2. give function a name
3.  name according to what it does
4.    aka 
5.    
6.int main ()
7{
return 0;
 }
 void sayHi () {
    printf("Hello Person reading this");
 }

// but ive seen it the oher way around with print first and return at the end
